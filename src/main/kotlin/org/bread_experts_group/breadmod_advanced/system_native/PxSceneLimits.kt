/**
 * Class used to retrieve limits(e.g. maximum number of bodies) for a scene. The limits
 * are used as a hint to the size of the scene, not as a hard limit (i.e. it will be possible
 * to create more objects than specified in the scene limits).
 *
 * 0 indicates no limit. Using limits allows the SDK to preallocate various arrays, leading to
 * less re-allocations and faster code at runtime.
